    Scenario for a demo of VoiceCode
    ================================

Last modified: 2003-12-02


- Open file Data/TestData/large_buff.py

- Compile the symbols
  
- some good existing symbols to use
  * prof_test ("profile test")
  * init_attrs ("init attributes")
  * profConstrSmallObj ("profile constructor small object")

- go to the end of large_buff.py and start dictating there

- I find writing a bubble sort method works well cause it's 
  something everybody understand and I can program it in my sleep.


0. Correction
   ----------

The first time you have to do a correction, show the correction infrastructure.

Point out that:

- uses smart undo-redo

- automatically adapts so that it won't make the same mistake again (hopefully)


1. Code templates
   --------------

Dictate a simple class with a single method.

- Didn't have to pause anywhere in particular
  ... But could have

- Some stuff gets typed automatically (eg: self and list of arguments of 
  method)

- simple navigation with "do the following", "new statement" etc...

- automatic indentation

- show context sensitivity by saying "if check if okay then do"
  The first if gets interpreted as an if statement because it's at the 
  beginning of a line, but the second if is interpreted as being part of
  a new symbol.


2. Symbol dictation
   ----------------

- Dictate some new and some known symbols with different formattings:
   * prof_test
   * profCOnstrSmallObj)

- Dictate a new symbol

- Dictate a new class name within a "define method" utterance, and show that
  the class was automatically formatted using CapitalHungarian formatting

- When we have a symbol correction dialog working, show how that's done.


3. Local navigation by punctuation
   -----------------------------

- Navigate by different punctuation marks

- Show how you can qualify the search with 
   * "previous one"
   * "next one"

- Show how you can repeat the commands
   * "again"
   * "again 2 times"

- Point out that there are other repeatable commands


4. Local navigation by PseudoCode
   ------------------------------

-  move to a line by selecting parts of it

- then insert a new statement above it


5. Global navigation by switch buffer
   ----------------------------------

- Make sure at least two buffers opened

- "Emacs switch buffer", "select buffer name", "newline"


6. Multiple ways of saying the same thing
   --------------------------------------

- "class some class"
- "define class some class"
- "class definition some class"


7. Language sensitivity
   --------------------

Dictate same class definition in C and Python files and show the difference.
