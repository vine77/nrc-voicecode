Todo list for VoiceCode

config.py

-- Alain

CSCmd should have a __setattr__ method that intercepts sets to the
*meanning* attribute. It would check to make sure that each entry in
meanings is OK, i.e. it's a pair with 1st element being a context
instance and the second being a function pointer.

This would address the common mistake where a user adds the following
configuration statement.

add_csc(spoken_forms=['for loop'], meanings=[[ContC, c_simple_for]])

i.e. the user forgets to add () after ContC, which means he is making
the context be the ContC class itself (as opposed to a ContC INSTANCE)


Grammar for spoken forms
------------------------

Instead of having to encode all the spoken forms of a command from
scratch, it would be better to allow grammar rules instead.

For example instead of:

spoken_forms=['after ;', 'after semi', 'after semicolon', 'goto semi', 'goto semicolon', 'goto ;', 'go semi', 'go semicolon', 'go ;', 'go after semi', 'go after semicolon', 'go after ;']

we could have:

spoken_forms=['after* (semi|semicolon|;)', 'go after* (semi|semicolon|;)']


Symbol translation
------------------

- When a word in a symbol doesn't correspond to an in-vocab word or a
  known abbreviation, we should see if it's a concatenation or such
  words and/or abbreviations.
