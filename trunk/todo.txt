CSCmd should have a __setattr__ method that intercepts sets to the
*meanning* attribute. It would check to make sure that each entry in
meanings is OK, i.e. it's a pair with 1st element being a context
instance and the second being a function pointer.

This would address the common mistake where a user adds the following
configuration statement.

add_csc(spoken_forms=['for loop'], meanings=[[ContC, c_simple_for]])

i.e. the user forgets to add () after ContC, which means he is making
the context be the ContC class itself (as opposed to a ContC INSTANCE)
