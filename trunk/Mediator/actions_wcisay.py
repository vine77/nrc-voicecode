    Moves to instance of class WhatCanISay, written mainly by Quintijn Hoogenbooms
    This instance makes a current language aware overview of LSAs (and later) CSCs.
    The info is presented in HTML format and opened with webbrowser in the default browser.

    Default is info on current language, all commands, except common like punctuation

    When curr_context is set, the current context will be checked, only the valid commands
    are given (interpreted "by hand"), because the real interpreter is not asked for.
    But if a CSC matches a possible LSA with the same spoken_form is ignored.
    If more (Context, Action) combinations match, they are both given, but in practice the first will
    be executed.

    When all_lang is set (may not together with  curr_context), a full website with all languages AND
    all common commands (like punctuation) is produced..
